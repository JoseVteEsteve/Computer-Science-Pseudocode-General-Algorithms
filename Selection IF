//selection is one of the most used control structures in programming
//one formal way to use selection is by using IF statements, that can be:
//  - simple IF...THEN...ENDIF
//  - simple IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF
//  - nested IFs --> IF...THEN...ELSE...IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF...ENDIF

//simple IF...THEN...ENDIF statements are used when only the True result is necessary in the program.
//the structure is

IF condition
  THEN
    true_result
ENDIF

//simple IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF statements are used when the True result and the False result are needed by the programmer
//the structure is

IF condition
  THEN
    true_result
  ELSE
    false_result
ENDIF

//nested IFs are used when there are more than one condition that must be avaluated into the program
//the structure is

IF condition1
  THEN
    true_result_1
  ELSE
    IF condition_2
      THEN
        true_result_2
      ELSE
        false_result
    ENDIF
ENDIF

//a special case can be used when two or more simple IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF structures are performed in sequence
//the difference with nested IFs is that the second condition will be evaluated independently of the first condition

IF condition1
  THEN
    true_result1
  ELSE
    false_result1
ENDIF
//the first if statement has been ended
//the second if statement begins now, but does not depend on the result of the previous IF
IF condition_2
  THEN
    true_result2
  ELSE
    false_result2
