//totalling is used when some data must be entered into the program and added to calculate a total sum
//if the quantity of data to be added up is know, a FOR loop is the best suitable iteration technique

//at the beginning of the program, a variable called Total (or Sum, for example) is initialised as 0
Total <-- 0

//the FOR loop is used to enter data into the program and add up these data in the same variable called Total. 
//This is the process called Totalling

//supose that N elements must be added together and there is a variable called Number (for example) that will be used to store temporarily
//those data that will be added

FOR Count <-- 1 TO N
  INPUT Number
  Total <-- Total + Number
NEXT Count
ENDFOR

PRINT ("The total is",Total)

//end of the program
