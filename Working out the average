//calculate the average is a must have in IGCSE Computer Science. 
//you should know how to calculate the total of an amount of numbers

//at the beginning of the program, a variable called Total (or Sum, for example) is initialised as 0
Total <-- 0

//the FOR loop is used to enter data into the program and add up these data in the same variable called Total. 
//This is the process called Totalling

//supose that N elements must be added together and there is a variable called Number (for example) that will be used to store temporarily
//those data that will be added

FOR Count <-- 1 TO N
  INPUT Number
  Total <-- Total + Number
NEXT Count
ENDFOR

//to calculate the average, the value of Total must be divided into N (the number of elements added)

Average <-- Total/N
PRINT("The average is",Average)

//end of the program
