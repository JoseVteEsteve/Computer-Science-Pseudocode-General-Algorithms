//CASE structure is a selection structure like IF statements that is normally used when there are more than three different conditions to
//be evaluated
//is used instead on IF statements to save time and paper when writing IF, ELSE, THEN, ENDIF, ...
//the structure is easier than IF statements

//the structure is the following (and depends on a condition)

CASE Variable OF
  Value1 : Result1
  Value2 : Result2
  ....
  ....
  ....
  ValueN : ResultN
  OTHERWHILE ResultM
ENDCASE

//the following example will illustrate this structure
CASE Mark OF
  >9 : "A*"
  >8 : "A"
  >7 : "B"
  >6 : "C"
  OTHERWHISE "U"
ENDCASE
