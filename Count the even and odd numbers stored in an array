//in this pseudocode algorithm, an array of N positive whole numbers is suposed to be filled in

//this technique implies to traverse the array, calculate the modulus (remainder) of each number with the divisor 2 and:
//  - in case the remainder is 0, the number will be even so the EvenCounter will be updated
//  - in case the remainder is 1, the number will be odd so the OddCounter will be updated

//to traverse the array, a FOR loop will be used

//at the very beginning, two counters called OddCounter and EvenCounter will be initialised as 0

OddCounter <-- 0
EvenCounter <-- 0

//also, an array of N numbers will be declared (we supose that the array is called Numbers)

Numbers [1:N]

//the FOR loop will be used to traverse the array and inside the FOR loop, an IF-ELSE statement will be used to know if the number is 
//even or odd

FOR Counter <-- 1 TO N
  IF Numbers[Count] MOD 2 = 0
    THEN
      EvenCounter <-- EvenCounter + 1
    ELSE
      OddCounter <-- OddCounter + 1
   ENDIF
NEXT Count
ENDFOR

//at least, the counter of even and odd numbers must be printed out
PRINT("There are",EvenCount,"even numbers in the array")
PRINT("There are",OddCount,"odd numbers in the array")

//the program ends ;)
