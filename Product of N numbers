//to multiply N numbers together, a variable called Product must be initialised as 1
//this algorithm is like Totalling but, changing:
//  - the variable Total initialised as 0 by variable Product initialised as 1
//  - the addition of Total <-- Total + Number is changed by the product Product <-- Product*Number

//the algorithm has the following structure

Product <-- 1
FOR Count <-- 1 TO N
  INPUT Number
  Product <-- Product*Number
NEXT Count
ENDFOR

PRINT Product 

//the program ends
