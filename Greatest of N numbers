//this algorithm has the main objective to obtain and print the greatest number of three numbers entered into the program
//two IF sentences will be used to know what is the greatest number like:
//  - the first IF sentence will help us to know if the number 1 is the greatest of the three numbers
//  - the second IF sentence will help us to know if the number 2 or the number 3 is the greatest

INPUT Number1, Number2, Number3

IF Number1 > Number2 AND Number1 > Number3
  THEN
    PRINT Number1,"is the greatest number"
  ELSE
    IF Number2 > Number3 AND Number2 > Number1
      THEN
        PRINT Number2,"is the greatest number"
      ELSE
        PRINT Number3,"is the greatest number"
