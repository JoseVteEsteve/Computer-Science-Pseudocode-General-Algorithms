//this algorithm is normally applied when the elements of the array are numbers but, it can also be applied when the elements are characters
//the algorithm consists in create a variable called Sum (or Total) initialised as 0 at the very beginning of the program
//then, the array is declared (and we supose that is filled in with some data)
//after, the array is traversed using a FOR loop to eventually add the items to the variable Sum
//at least, the sum value is printed out

Sum <-- 0
Numbers[1:N] //the array contains N numbers

FOR Num <-- 1 TO N
  Total <-- Total + Numbers[Num]
NEXT Count
ENDFOR

PRINT "The total is",Total

//in case of an "addition" of characters, the structure is the same but the difference is that there is no Sum variable
//at the very beginning, an empty string is initialised

String <-- ""
Characters[1:N] //the array contains N characters

FOR Char <-- 1 TO N
  String <-- String + Char
NEXT Count
ENDFOR

PRINT "The string formed has been",String

//the program ends ;)
